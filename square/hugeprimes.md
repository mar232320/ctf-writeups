I had to factorize the number `22952152323332505688670761214671498225451684330137990990356473040741684014997701799009910066964917896400501477` to two prime numbers

I tried factordb but the number wasn't factorized there. In the program sourcecode it checks if two numbers multiplied are equal to this number and both of them are greater or equal than 2. But the program didn't check if the numbers are prime. So I simply divided the number by 2 and got `11476076161666252844335380607335749112725842165068995495178236520370842007498850899504955033482458948200250738.5`

Inputting these 2 numbers into the website gave me the flag
